A really simple Python script that provides a randomised order for presenting within the online daily team Lambda meetings. Run it in Python 3.6+.

## Running the Script
1. Run `python3 meeting_scheduler.py`.
2. From the list presented, enter the number of each participant who is present, and push `ENTER`.
3. When everyone has been selected, push `ENTER` once more.

It is that simple! ðŸ¤“
